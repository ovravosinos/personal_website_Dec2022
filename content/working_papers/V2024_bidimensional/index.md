abstract: |
  A principal wants to choose whether to accept or reject an agent. The principal can perform a costly test that measures a combination of the agent's valuable qualities without revealing each quality separately. The agent can present evidence on some qualities but not others. I call the latter qualities talent. Although favorable, evidence can make the principal ascribe the test result to a certain quality, thereby negatively affecting his assessment of the agent's talent. Thus, testing may interfere with the agent's incentives to present evidence. Indeed, when the test is less sensitive to talent than talent is valuable to the principal, a conflict arises between the two evaluation methods: (i) testing and (ii) asking for evidence. The optimal mechanism leads to two types of errors, both favoring high- over low-evidence agents: (i) It accepts without testing some unworthy high-evidence agents, and (ii) it accepts after testing some unworthy medium-evidence agents while rejecting some worthy low-evidence ones.
