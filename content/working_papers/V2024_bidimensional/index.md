abstract: |
  A principal must decide whether to accept or reject an agent. The principal can verify at a cost the value of a composite measure of the agent's training and talent. The measure does not reveal training and talent separately. The agent can present evidence of training but not of talent. Although favorable, evidence can make the principal ascribe the value of the composite measure to training, thereby negatively affecting his assessment of the agent's talent. Thus, verification may distort the agent's incentives to present evidence. Indeed, when the composite measure is less sensitive to talent than talent is valuable to the principal, the optimal mechanism never asks for evidence an agent whose composite measure it verifies. In the optimal mechanism, errors favoring high- over low-training agents arise because (i) verification creates incentives for the agent to withhold evidence of training and (ii) the principal saves on verification costs by accepting an agent with high-training without verifying the composite measure. The two forces are complements in inducing errors favoring high- over low-training agents.
