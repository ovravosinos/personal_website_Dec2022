abstract: I provide an axiomatic analysis of corporate control under common ownership. I show that the current canonical model of corporate control under common ownership imposes two restrictions on firm behavior: (i) that the firm is efficiently controlled, and (ii) that the distribution of power across shareholders within the firm depends only on the firm's ownership structure, and not on external factors such as the stakes of the firm's shareholders in competing firms, the strategies of other firms, or market conditions. I propose the Nash bargaining (NB) model, which models the firm's behavior as the result of asymmetric Nash bargaining among the firm's shareholders. NB generalizes the current canonical model by allowing for external factors to influence the distribution of power across the firm's shareholders. I characterize how additional restrictions on firm behavior constrain the class of relevant WAPP and NB models. The results guide researchers and practitioners on how to model corporate control under common ownership and how to robustly test the common ownership hypothesis.
