abstract: Regret in games has so far been analyzed as if in a single-agent context with the other players' actions treated as the state of the world. I instead propose the strategic regret approach, which accounts for the division of responsibility in games. It postulates that player i's regret (for not playing a best-response) is mitigated through blame put on player j for not playing (when available) a Pareto-improving (compared to j's actual action) best-response to player i's action. I show that strategic regret brings theoretical predictions closer to existing experimental results. Last, I provide direct experimental evidence that (i) blame mitigates regret and (ii) feelings of regret and blame elicited in certain games predict behavior in vastly different games, consistent with theoretical predictions.
