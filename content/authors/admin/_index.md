**About:** I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics of the University of Chicago. I completed my PhD at the Department of Economics of New York University. I work in microeconomic theory (including mechanism design, game theory, industrial organization, and competition policy), behavioral economics, and experimental economics.
